      div.col
        h3 What is the populate feature?
        p.
          What mongoose describes as population, is essentially the replacement of a reference within one collection through the corresponding entries of a second collection.
          These entries have to be referenced by their Object ID.

          p #{movie.title}
          p #{movie.director.name}
